As we all know the global proliferation of COVID-19 pandemic has lead to abrupt closure of universities, schools, colleges, offline coaching centers etc to an uncertain period to shield the population from the viral contamination. Though with the passage of time the world is coming in terms with this pandemic and trying hard to restore things to normal pace but that is a long and tedious walk.  The onset of coronavirus virus laid the groundwork for the boom of a hitherto auxiliary online edutech industry. You must have read in various newspaper that edtech sector has emerged as the hot sector with Byju’s raising $400 million and Unacademy raising $100 million in the first quarter of 2020. According to a KPMG report - online coaching has seen a massive boost since lockdown. Almost every other online platform has opened up its content for free making it accessible for all students. Even in a challenging environment, edtech is expected to remain a very hot sector of VC investment.  Online coaching is on-demand, convenient and personalized. Every thing is available just in a matter of few seconds. Covid-19 has increased the digital transformation of the tutoring industry forcing individual tutors to adopt advanced technology to increase their reach and teach with more advanced methods. So as by now, going by the trend, online coaching industry has a good future to thrive as its consumption is increasing day by day. Also the law of supply and demand states- when demand exceeds supply, prices tend to rise and going by recent trend online coaching demand is sure-shot to increase thus escalating its revenue curve definitely.\",\"Now, the 21st century world is heading towards a brand new era of machine learning and it's functioning. In this era, we are able to speak to the machines, working for us, to improve their operations and modify them according to our needs. Artificial Intelligence is a ‘human-like-man-made-invention’ which will be capturing the whole world. Robotics is capable of spreading across the industries and trade practises, thus, replacing 65% of the existing jobs in next 7 years (researched based fact). All this directs our attention towards the alarming need of technically equipped minds as workforce in the coming decade in every evolving sector, around the globe.  So, the hidden agenda is to prepare 21st century kids with the most important invention that will prepare & equip them to contribute in the upcoming revolution.  This demands the requirement of a platform and a teaching window for our kids which can open up their mind to envision themselves as the prospect future of our globe. The current wave of Edutech industry is transforming itself under the leadership of Karan Bajaj (EX-CEO of Discovery channel) and the contributions initiated by his global online 1-1 teaching startup - Whitehat Jr. It's the only company with an academically designed coding teaching pedagogy for kids which is growing at an exponential rate of 50% per month. You can access more information on their website\",\"Parents and teachers are aware of the many benefits of coding or programming for kids and students. Among other benefits, kids learn computational thinking, problem solving, and prepares them for skills needed in a world that is increasingly dependent on technology ran by computer programs behind the scenes.  When kids are introduced to coding, they gain appreciation of how digital technology work. Digital technology is a big part of many kids’ lives, as they are surrounded by smart phones, video games, video entertainment, websites, and even robots. What drives this technology are software or computer programs that are created by coding.  Like learning about biology and chemistry, it is important for kids to understand the building blocks of an integral part of their life. They need to realize that what happens when they use technology is not magic, and they themselves can create programs that can be useful.  Keep in mind though that every child is different. Some kids take a larger amount of time to learn the concepts while others who are naturally inclined to computational thinking breeze through learning even at a young age.  Childs’ brain is self-observant in learning the linguistic & gestural languages which is used in his/her surroundings to communicate his mind, right after their birth. Its a process of behavioural adaptation of the knowledge unconsciously ringing in kids’ ears, which helps childs’ brain to apply the basic of their respective native language.  Similarly, starting from the basic is the most effective and efficient process to start with.  Similarities - There is not much difference in both the process of learning this language of computers to that of learning their native language, for child's brain. But, the methods pursued by most of the undergrad educators in the edutech industry has overlooked this most important feature of teaching a practical language like coding. Instead, we can focus on the methods of an organisation which has developed world's first online “coding” teaching pedagogy for kids - Whitehat Jr.  We can focus on the methods of an organisation which has developed world's first online “coding” teaching pedagogy for kids - Whitehat Jr.  Whitehat Jr - This works under the leadership of - Founder and CEO Karan Bajaj (EX-CEO of Discovery channel).

The argument of Raghuram Rajan was we should build manufacturing and infra but most of OECD countries have Services as the their biggest contributor to GDP, India also has a similar strength. I partially agree his statement we can't make infrastructure as fast as China due to laws and different policy takes lot of time. It is better to build infrastructure and work on our strength like IT. We can expand into sectors like Banking and Edutech as the youth coming in the sectors won't like to work as low skill labours in manufacturing sector.  If a country has a good section of educated people they can pretty much drive the economy in every sector. We can do both. We need agricultural manufacturing capacities like fertilizers, industrial and manufacturing growth to propele and sustain our population needs.  Anugrhitoasmi 💛\"]"
